Overview:-
    This project explores data collected from an audience who were asked to rate their anger issues on a scale from 0 to 100.
    The data was saved in a CSV file and visualized as a line graph to understand the distribution of anger ratings.

Data Processing:-
    The collected data was distributed into intervals (0-10, 10-20, ..., 90-100) using a dictionary.
    Each interval represents the count of individuals falling within that range of anger ratings.

Visualization:-
    The final output is a visually appealing graph created using Matplotlib, showcasing the distribution of anger ratings.
  Graph Attributes:-
      -> X-axis: Percentage intervals (0-100)
      -> Y-axis: Number of people
